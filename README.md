<h3>Random facts about me:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I will always say yes to cake :cake:, even if it is a lie</li>
  <li>I love, daresay luuuurrrrve, planning notebooks and apps</li>
  <li>One can never have too many books :books: or skeins of yarn :yarn:</li>
  <li>I will spend my lifetime learning and still be like Jon Snow.</li>
  <li>I believe magic :magic_wand: exists. Anyone who has been stuck on a thorny coding problem
    only to instantly know the solution after a good night's sleep knows exactly what I'm
    talking about.</li>
</ul>
